# ReciPy - web application with an integrated recommender system for recipes

Recipy is a recipe recommendation system developed as a part of Graduation Project. This recommender is implemented into a web application. The back-end of the application is built using **Python** and **Flask**. The front-end is constructed with **Jinja2** template engine and **Bootstrap**. The recommender engine uses **Python**, **scikit-learn**, **NumPy** and **Pandas**.



The user can create an account, after login the user can look for cooking inspiration and recipes. Each recipe can be rated. The rating system is essential for the machine learning model to learn about user’s preferences. The application is designed for users who look for recipes online on a daily basis. The goal of this project is to utilise machine learning techniques to develop a recommender system which can suggest new recipes based on user's historical behaviour. Besides development, my work includes background research, concept development and project management.
